This repository contains some example codes for some questions. 

# FairIndexSolution
	Finds fair index count of two arrays. Fair index means an index that means giving same calculation result in both of arrays. 
	Input: 
	[4,-1,0,3] [-2,5,0,3]
	Output: 
	2 fair indexes --> 2 and 3 are fair indexes.
	Because if fair index is 2, in first array 4 + (-1) = 0 + 3, in second array -2 + 5 = 0 + 3.
	If fair index is 3, in first array 4 + (-1) + 0 = 3, in second array -2 + 5 + 0 = 3

# Placing5ToGetMaxNumberSolution
	Produces maximum number with placing 5 into right index of number.
    Input:  268
    Output: 5268
	Input:  670
	Output: 6750
	
# ProductOfTwoConsecutiveIntegerSolution
	Finds count of numbers that are product of 2 consecutive numbers in given range.
	Input: 6 and 20.
	Output: 3 because 2*3=6, 3*4=12, 4*5=20
